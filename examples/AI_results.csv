Okay, the user just said ""Hello!"" so I need to respond appropriately. Since they're greeting me, a simple and friendly reply would be best. Maybe start with a greeting and offer assistance. Let me check if there's anything else they might need. But since there's no specific question, keeping it open-ended is good. Make sure to keep the tone positive and helpful.
