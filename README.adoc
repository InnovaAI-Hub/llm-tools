== Description

LLM Tools is a modular and extensible framework for working with Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It provides a **single configurable pipeline** for both *fine-tuning* and *inference* of different models, powered by Hugging Face, vLLM, Unsloth, and PEFT.  

With centralized YAML configuration, you can switch between models, trainers, and runners without modifying code.

== Key Features

* Unified pipeline for *training* and *inference*.
* Configurable via YAML – change the model or runner without touching code.
* Supports Hugging Face, vLLM, Unsloth, PEFT adapters.
* Dataset utilities with dialog/message abstractions.
* Metric evaluation, including Rouge and SVG-based visualization.
* Extensible architecture: add new runners, trainers, or metrics easily.

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- `rye` for environment and dependency management.

=== Steps

. Clone this repository:
+
[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/llm-tools.git
cd llm-tools
----

. Set up environment with Rye:
+
[,bash]
----
rye sync
----

. Install the package:
+
[,bash]
----
pip install .
----

== Usage

LLM Tools operates through YAML configuration files.  
You only need to update the configuration to switch models or pipelines.

=== Inference

Check the `examples/` directory for runnable scripts.

== Configuration

All pipeline behavior is defined via YAML files.  

* `model_configs/` – predefined model configs (LLaMA 3, Qwen, etc.)

== Future Plans

* Extend example scripts for more use cases (chatbots, alignment, evaluation).
* Provide detailed YAML schema documentation.
* Add adapter/dataset storage integration with DVC.

== Dependencies

Core dependencies:

* Python 3.12+
* torch
* transformers
* vllm
* unsloth
* peft
* datasets
* evaluate
* pandas
* pydantic

(see `pyproject.toml` for the complete list)
